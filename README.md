# 1 year on...

Exactly one year ago, on this day, I created my GitHub account. And what a journey it has been.

At first, it was rather overwhelming. I was a small developer completely unaware of my surroundings in the community. It wasn't that way for long, though, as I managed to firm my grip and commit my code regularly to the site.

In terms of following, we started with almost none. However, thanks to you all, I reached 100 followers in early June, and then 200 at the start of this month. 

But there has also been growth in terms of languages. I had joined GitHub as an intermediate Python developer, but then found the motivation to pursue web development in HTML, CSS & JavaScript. The numbers on Codersrank are staggering, and you all provide the motivation for me to keep going.

On the downside, I am aware that I have not been reguarly uploading videos to my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@CM7K). I can assure you that this will change in the fuutre, starting with a 1 year on GitHub special. As always, stay followed and subscribed!

Thank you!
